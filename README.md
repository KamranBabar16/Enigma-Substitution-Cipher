# substitution-cipher

This PHP code provides a simple implementation of a substitution cipher, which can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. The cipher works by replacing each letter in the message with a corresponding value from a predefined key.

The $key array defines the key for the cipher, which is a mapping of letters to their corresponding replacements. The encrypt() function takes a message and the key as input and replaces each letter in the message with its corresponding value from the key. The decrypt() function takes an encrypted message and the key as input and replaces each encrypted letter with the original letter from the key.

Note that this implementation is a very basic example and should not be used for any real encryption or decryption purposes. It is also not a complete implementation of the Enigma machine, which was a more sophisticated cipher device used by Germany during World War II.

This code can be used as a starting point for building more complex encryption and decryption systems or for educational purposes to understand the principles behind substitution ciphers.
